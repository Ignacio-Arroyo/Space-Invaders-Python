Hi,

first of all, thanks for downloading the game. For it to work, you just have to make sure to download the whole folder with everything inside and double click on the pco.py file and you are ready to play.
If you want to scoreboard to reset. You can manually erase everything contained on the scoreboard.json file.

Best regards,
Ignacio Arroyo
